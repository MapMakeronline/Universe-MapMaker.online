# Diagnostic Report - Project Creation & Fetching Issue

## Date: 2025-10-09

## Problem Summary
Projects are being created successfully (showing success message), but they don't appear in the dashboard project list.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Frontend Investigation
✅ **Auth working:** User "admin" is authenticated correctly
✅ **Redux working:** State management functioning properly
✅ **API calls working:** Both create and fetch requests execute successfully  
❌ **Backend returns empty list:** GET `/dashboard/projects/` returns `{list_of_projects: []}`

### Backend Issue Confirmed
```bash
$ node test-admin-projects.js
Logged in as: admin ID: 1
Projects count: 0
```

**User "admin" (ID: 1) has 0 projects in database**, despite creating:
- Schronyyy
- Szachy  
- Szach

## Possible Causes

1. **Database Persistence Issue**
   - Projects created via `/dashboard/projects/create/` are not being saved to database
   - OR: Transaction rollback happening after creation

2. **User ID Mismatch**
   - Projects being assigned to different user ID
   - Frontend sends correct auth token, but backend assigns to wrong user

3. **Endpoint Discrepancy**
   - CREATE endpoint writes to one table/database
   - GET endpoint reads from different table/database

## Frontend Changes Made

1. ✅ Enabled production logging for critical loggers (`mapLogger`, `reduxLogger`, `apiLogger`)
2. ✅ Fixed data format in `CreateProjectDialog` (uses `CreateProjectData` format)
3. ✅ Updated `projectsApi.createProject()` to use `/dashboard/projects/create/` endpoint
4. ✅ Added comprehensive logging to diagnose issues

## Next Steps (Backend Required)

1. **Verify database writes:** Check if projects are actually being written to PostgreSQL/Railway
2. **Check user association:** Verify correct user ID is linked to created projects  
3. **Review GET endpoint:** Ensure `/dashboard/projects/` queries correct table with correct user filter
4. **Add backend logging:** Log project creation and retrieval operations

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test admin user projects
node test-admin-projects.js

# Test project creation flow
node test-project-creation.js

# Full integration test
node test-auth-integration.js
```

## Conclusion

**Frontend is working correctly.** The issue is on the backend - projects are not being persisted or retrieved properly. Backend team needs to investigate database writes and user association logic.
